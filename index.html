                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p class = "code-skill-description"> I first learned to code 5 years ago while looking for a major. After basic training and starting my
                    career with the Air
                    National Guard, I decided to take advantage of the schooling benefits that I earned from serving. In
                    my mind, I went with something that was going to be around for awhile, Computer Science. After
                    taking a few classes here and there, I fell in love!

                <h3>Skiing</h3>
                <p class = "colorado-skill-description">My wife and I love to ski, it's the only way we survive the long winter season. We first started this
                    tradition 6 years ago over New Years Eve. Since then, we have made it a point to go atleast once a
                    year.
                    This last year was definitley our best year as we went to Steamboat Springs, Boyne Mounain, and
                    Boyne Highlands with Chestnut in between.
